## Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes sales data from Blinkit Grocery to generate insights and recommendations. The project was divided into two phases: **Data Cleaning** and **Dashboard Creation**. The final dashboard provides an interactive report for sales performance analysis, enabling users to filter data by various categories, outlets, and years.

## Data Cleaning
In the **Data Cleaning** phase, the Power Query Editor was used to:
- Convert data types
- Remove errors and duplicate values
- Correct category names
- Remove null values

These transformations ensured that the data was clean and ready for analysis.

## Dashboard Creation
The **Dashboard Creation** phase involved building various visuals and writing DAX measures to derive key insights:
- **Parametric Chart:** Displays multiple types of information using three dynamic visuals
- **Line Chart:** Year-wise analysis of Blinkit’s sales
- **Pie Chart:** Sales amount distribution by outlet size
- **Funnel Chart:** Sales by outlet location
- **Tabular View:** Shows sales, total items sold, item visibility, and average rating for different outlet types
- **Card Visuals:** Key metrics such as overall sales, total items sold, average rating, and average sales
- **Slicers:** Filter data by outlet location type, establishment year, and item type
- **Clear Filters Button:** Allows users to clear all filters at once for better user experience

The dashboard is designed in line with Blinkit’s brand theme to provide a cohesive and professional look.

## Key Insights
1. **Total Sales:** Blinkit has generated $1.2 million in total sales over the years.
2. **Total Items Sold:** Blinkit offers 8523 different types of items.
3. **Average Rating:** The average customer rating across all products is 3.9.
4. **Best Year:** 2018 was the top-performing year, with $205K in sales.
5. **Top Location:** Outlets in Tier-3 locations brought in the highest sales, contributing $472K.
6. **Outlet Size:** Medium-sized outlets yielded the highest sales, generating $508K.
7. **Most Sold Items:** Fruits and vegetables are the most sold items, but dairy items have the highest visibility.
8. **Product Preferences:** Customers tend to buy more low-fat products than regular-fat ones.
9. **Outlet Type:** Type 1 supermarkets are the most popular outlet type, generating the most sales and offering the most items.

## Recommendations
1. **Focus on Low-Fat Products:** Given their strong sales, Blinkit should expand its offerings of low-fat products.
2. **Monitor Dairy Items:** Despite high visibility, dairy products are not generating proportional sales. Investigating the cause could lead to improvement.
3. **Leverage 2018 Strategy:** The high sales in 2018 suggest that reviewing the strategies used during that year could help boost future sales.


## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit’s sales performance, offering valuable insights into product preferences, outlet effectiveness, and customer behavior. The report is designed for ease of use and interactivity, making it a powerful tool for decision-making.
